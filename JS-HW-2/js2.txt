why cycles are needed in a programming.

my answer: because without cycles we would wrote the same line of code again and again maybe even 1000 times.It helps us to write less code and let the program do that repeating for us. The main slogan in programming is dont repeat yourself, also with cycles we can check every value of some big data , object , array etc.
